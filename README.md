# This is my pet project was written on a knee just for fun inspired by https://demo.mobiscroll.com/react/timeline/month-view#. 
### Also I'm planning to improve it from time to time
## You can play with it on https://abelovq.github.io/timeline-calendar/ 
### Features will be added as todo list in the future as well as covering by tests (some of them are available now)
### For now you can create event on some date, move it by axis x, change event's date and time by dragging it, delete by clicking on event and press key Delete on keyboard
### It works as a react reusable component
